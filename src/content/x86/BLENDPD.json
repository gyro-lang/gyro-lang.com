The immediate bits [3:0] determine whether the corresponding double precision floating-point value in the destination is copied from the second source or first source. If a bit in the mask, corresponding to a word, is ”1”, then the double precision floating-point value in the second source operand is copied, else the value in the first source operand is copied.\n\n128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are unmodified.\n\nVEX.128 encoded version: the first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are zeroed.\n\nVEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.\n\n","operation":"","flagsAffected":"","protectedModeExceptions":null,"realAddressModeExceptions":null,"virtual8086ModeExceptions":null,"compatibilityModeExceptions":null,"mode64BitExceptions":null}
