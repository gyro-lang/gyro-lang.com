Subtracts the even-numbered single precision floating-point values from the second source operand from the corresponding single precision floating values in the first source operand; stores the result into the even-numbered values of the destination operand.\n\nIn 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).\n\n128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are unmodified. See Figure 3-4.\n\nVEX.128 encoded version: the first source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are zeroed.\n\nVEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.\n\n","operation":"","flagsAffected":"","protectedModeExceptions":null,"realAddressModeExceptions":null,"virtual8086ModeExceptions":null,"compatibilityModeExceptions":null,"mode64BitExceptions":null}
