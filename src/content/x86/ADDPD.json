The second source operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register conditionally updated with writemask k1.\n\nVEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are zeroed.\n\nVEX.128 encoded version: the first source operand is a XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are zeroed.\n\n128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are unmodified.\n\n","operation":"","flagsAffected":"","protectedModeExceptions":null,"realAddressModeExceptions":null,"virtual8086ModeExceptions":null,"compatibilityModeExceptions":null,"mode64BitExceptions":null}
