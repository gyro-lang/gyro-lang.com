The AL register is the implied source and destination operand for this instruction. The AAS instruction is only useful when it follows a SUB instruction that subtracts (binary subtraction) one unpacked BCD value from another and stores a byte result in the AL register. The AAA instruction then adjusts the contents of the AL register to contain the correct 1-digit unpacked BCD result.\n\nIf the subtraction produced a decimal carry, the AH register decrements by 1, and the CF and AF flags are set. If no decimal carry occurred, the CF and AF flags are cleared, and the AH register is unchanged. In either case, the AL register is left with its top four bits set to 0.\n\nThis instruction executes as described in compatibility mode and legacy mode. It is not valid in 64-bit mode.\n\n","operation":"IF 64-bit mode\n    THEN\n        #UD;\n    ELSE\n        IF ((AL AND 0FH) > 9) or (AF = 1)\n            THEN\n                AX := AX – 6;\n                AH := AH – 1;\n                AF := 1;\n                CF := 1;\n                AL := AL AND 0FH;\n            ELSE\n                CF := 0;\n                AF := 0;\n                AL := AL AND 0FH;\n        FI;\nFI;\n","flagsAffected":"The AF and CF flags are set to 1 if there is a decimal borrow; otherwise, they are cleared to 0.
