If the source operand is zero BLSR sets CF.\n\nThis instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode.

An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD.\n\n","operation":"temp := (SRC-1) bitwiseAND ( SRC );\nSF := temp[OperandSize -1];\nZF := (temp = 0);\nIF SRC = 0\n    CF := 1;\nELSE\n    CF := 0;\nFI\nDEST := temp;\n","flagsAffected":"ZF and SF flags are updated based on the result.
